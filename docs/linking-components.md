# Linking Components

## `<Link>`

`<Link>` is a React component that extends the HTML `<a>` element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
}
```
